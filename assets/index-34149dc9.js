 It's worth mentioning that after the gun tutorial, there is one more combat, and after that, your team will be healed to full on both HP and SP so do not waste any healing items unless you find yourself in a bad situation; 
 In Persona 5 Royal, ammo replenishes every fight. They are a good tool early game because emptying the gun at an enemy deals significantly more damage than normal attacks;

 If you want to follow the Recommended Fusion Path and the Personas to capture in Shadow Information, it starts now. These tables are a “recommended” fusion path for people that want a super-easy experience without going deep into the fusion system. You can capture and fuse any Persona you want even if following the Recommended Fusion Path If you aren’t high enough level to capture a Persona you don’t need to grind, there is always a way to fuse or capture it later If you don't want to follow the Fusion Path, capture every Persona you encounter because they are necessary for Confidant Bonuses and Strength Ranks. If you don't follow the Fusion path and aren't capturing Personas, you won't be able to keep up with the schedule, so do one or the other You have to grind some money before proceeding with the story. In a few days, we will spend all of it. The goal is 15.000 yen. Sometimes knocking down enemies and demanding money gives more than killing them does. It depends on the amount and type of enemy you are fighting. In a battle with a lot of enemies (3 or more), it will give more money to kill them all The level of the enemy will also affect how much money they will give when you hold them at gunpoint. Higher-level enemies give more money In a few days, we will need 2 Tin Claps and 2 Silk Yarn. If you drop them from enemies, great. If not, we will have to buy it. Tin Claps cost 2.050 each and Silk Yarn costs 1.150 each. Add the ones you need to your farming total, so if you need to buy 2 Tin Claps, you will need 19.100 total. DO NOT go past the room with three Shadows and one Treasure Chest, otherwise, you will be locked into a story event and you won’t be able to grind anymore. Kill the three Shadows, go back to the entrance, save the game, and repeat; 
 When you have the necessary money, continue forward to start the story events. Remember that you can check Special Enemies for information about boss fights;

If you want to buy something, you need to farm more money.

 Fourth Castle Infiltration, for real this time; 
 During the Persona fusion tutorial, fuse Arsene and Pixie to get Agathion (Chariot, 3). Pass on Eiha and Zio; 
 The number of skills you are able to pass down to a new Persona when fusing depends on the level of the Personas used. A level 1 Arsene fused with a level 2 Pixie will only net one inherit skill slot. So if you are not able to pass both Eiha and Zio in this case its because you are slightly underlevel. Farming for levels is not required unless the guide says that you need a specific skill obtained at a specific level If there is only one slot available its recommended to inherit Eiha since Agathion will learn Zio at level 7, and Pixie also has Zio from the start. The key to combat is having access to as many elements as possible Fool Rank 2; 
 This is a very difficult Palace because it’s so early in the game that we don’t have access to Personas, skills, or items to help us out, but we still need to finish it in one day otherwise we won’t be able to get everything in one playthrough. Keep multiple saves just to be safe and use the SP items bought from the vending machines; 
 This Palace features a puzzle where you need to find books in small rooms adjacent to a big library and then fit the books on the right shelves. The northern shelf that has books about the feats of Kamoshida is where you put the King Book. The eastern shelf that talks about girls in the volleyball team is the place for the Queen Book. And finally, the eastern shelf is where the Slave Book goes. After all the books are in place, a new path will open up; 
 Will Seeds are a new mechanic in Royal, there are 3 seeds to collect in every Palace. When all 3 are collected, they will turn into an accessory that gives a powerful skill to the person that uses it. They also recover a bit of SP every time one is collected, which is an huge deal in the early game; 
 Red Seed: it’s part of the tutorial, your teammates will tell you to go get it; 
 Once you reach the roof, the enemies will become quite strong. It's recommended to skip all the battles until you are inside the castle again. When the Treasure is found, you can farm as much as you like, but for now, focus on reaching the end of the Palace; 
 Green Seed: When you are using the grappling hook to climb the outside of the tower, the Seed will be at the very top. Enter the first window and crawl inside a vent to reach a higher area where you can use the grappling hook to get higher; 
 Blue Seed: Back inside the castle, when the rooms start to shift, take the elevator down. You will see another elevator in the new area that can't be used. Continue through Kamoshida’s painting to unlock a shortcut to the very beginning of the Palace. Explore this area to find a lever that activates the other elevator. Go back through the painting and use the new elevator that we just activated to go down to a new area and fight the first Will Seed Guardian; 
 Reach the treasure and farm until you are level 9 with 20.000 yen; 
 Fuse Silky and Agathion to get Berith (Hierophant, 9); 
 If you don't know who Silky is, the Shadow name can be found in the Shadows Information; 
 Leave the Palace after securing the route to the Treasure, fusing Berith, and getting the necessary money; 
 When you are ready to leave, make sure you have a Lovers Personas; 
 Almost every Sunday, you can check the TV and buy unique or rare items from the Shopping Program. Some of them are useful, others aren’t. This schedule was designed to have the money to buy from the Shopping Program every time; 
 There are always two options to choose from, and you can only pick one Today, the bundles are Spring Awake Set: 10 items that cure sleep and 10 that cure dizzy, as well as a Sleep Immunity accessory OR Share of Spring Set, 5 items that heal 10 SP each, 1 item that heals 40 HP to all allies, and 1 item that heals 80 HP to all allies.

 Tarunda is a must in this fight, especially on higher difficulties. Make sure you have it on Saki Mitama, Bicorn, or Ann; 
 Boss Suguru Asmodeus Kamoshida: keep him under Tarunda at all times, Rakunda can also be quite useful. Once he loses a certain amount of HP, he will heal using the chalice. Now, focus everything on the chalice until it breaks. Be sure to guard against his powerful attack (when Mishima or Shiho appear) otherwise, it can one-shot multiple people. It's possible to kill Shadow Shiho to prevent another big attack, she is weak against everything. After that, the game will enter a scripted event asking you to send someone to steal the crown from Kamoshida, while the person climbs the pillar, you will have to keep attacking Kamoshida, being unable to meet the damage requirement will make the person be spotted by Kamoshida and end the scripted event. This is not mandatory, but in lower difficulties it will end the battle a lot faster. On Merciless though, it can be a bad idea because of the lower damage dealt by your team it makes a lot harder to meet the requirement;

 In this Palace, Treasure Demon will be introduced. The one here is called Regent (Emperor, 10) and is part of the story so it can’t be missed. These special Shadows give a lot of money and experience when defeated but are also very helpful when captured. In every Palace there will be a new Treasure Demon and it's important that you capture all of them once; 
 Treasure Demons have a chance to appear every time you loot an object or start a battle. The chance increases the higher the Security Level of the Palace is. You can encounter multiple Regents in this Palace Using the ability Third Eye will highlight objects to loot, objects that do not have loot in them won't be highlighted but they still will have a chance of containing a Treasure Demons Regent is weak to Nuclear so use Makami’s Frei, Morgana's Lucky Punch skill, or have someone use the Atom Ring that can be found in a treasure chest in the area before this fight Red Seed: after turning off the first set of electric fences, go upstairs and use the grappling hook above. Drop down on the other side of the glass wall to find the Will Seed in front of you; 
 This is the first Palace that has a blockade that you can't go past. When you reach it, Morgana will explain that you need to do an action in the real world and then return to the Metaverse the next day;

 Green Seed: When you get to a storage room and drop down to a lower level, look for a grappling hook on the opposite side of the room. Activate the switch to open the gate to the Will Seed. The puzzle of this Palace consists in finding the real Sayuri painting amongst counterfeits. The real one has a tree branch in the background, the woman is wearing red, and has long hair over the shoulder. Click here to see a picture of the real one. Blue Seed: Once you see the treasure for the first time, proceed to the right hallway and there will be a vent in the left wall. Go inside and use the grappling hook to reach a new area where this Palace Guardian awaits. Once you secure the route to the Treasure, go to the entrance and a new ritual will be available in the Velvet Room; 
 This new ritual allows you to sacrifice a Persona and get an item. Every Persona will give different items and every sacrifice requires "ingredients" called Black Items Black Kogatana lets you sacrifice a Persona for a melee weapon. Model Gun is for ranged weapons, Black Rock for accessories, and Blank Cards for skill cards In the early stage of the game, these "ingredients" are quite rare, and sacrificing a Persona to immediately have to resummon it again can cost a lot of money. As the game progresses, this process will get a lot easier Sacrifice Makami to get the Frei Skill Card and capture an Ame-no-Uzume in the Palace; 
 If you don't have Makami, you can capture one in this Palace too Give Ame-no-Uzume the Frei Skill Card and talk with the Twins for Strength Rank 2;

 Before starting the fight make sure Joker has all basic elemental attacks (fire, ice, elec, and wind) and they can’t be the ones that hit all targets, they need to be single target; 
 Boss Ichiryusai Azazel Madarame: Madarame is one of the hardest bosses in the game if not the hardest, and that's for one simple reason, he can hit all your party members' weaknesses in one turn, essentially killing everyone from full HP. The Eyes drain elemental attacks and can cast all basic elemental spells, the Mouth drains physical attacks and attacks normally, and the Nose has Tarukaja and Rakunda. The best way to deal with the first phase is to use Rakunda in the Eyes and have Ryuji and Yusuke use AoE physical attacks (Yusuke needs to be level 18 to learn it) to neutralize the Eyes as soon as possible, with the Eyes out of the picture the boss gets a lot easier. In the second phase, Madarame starts summoning his elemental clones, and as you can expect, they are weak to their opposite element. Use ice against the red clones and fire against the blue, use wind against the yellow clones and elec against the green. Abuse Baton Pass by exploiting all the clones' weaknesses and kill them all in one turn. Just make sure you don’t use any spells that hit all targets because the clones will reflect their element back at you. The beginning of the second phase is a battle of attrition. Don't worry about Madarame, just make sure the clones die. Eventually, the clones will start getting weaker and easier to kill, then you can start getting some damage in Madarame himself;

 Boss Junya Bael Kaneshiro: Pyggitron has fire attacks so having Yusuke means the boss can get 1-Mores every turn, the usual Tarunda and Rakunda combo still works well. After a while Kaneshiro will come out of the robot and prepare the “Super VIP Attack”, be careful with that since it hits pretty hard. Eventually the game will give you an option to throw an expensive item to distract the boss, that in exchange, won’t attack for a few turns. It’s up to you if you want to waste a good item or not. Every member of your group will suggest a different item and only the rarest one will work. Since the items they pick are random there is no way to tell what will work beforehand. When the robot is destroyed, Kaneshiro will summon bodyguards that are resistant to all attacks so the best way to deal with them is to set up Technical Attacks with Dormina or any other status ailments that you can apply. Kaneshiro himself can be put to sleep as well when the bodyguards are defeated. Shiki-Ouji is extremely helpful in this fight, especially in the last phase where the boss will keep using Lullaby and Technical Attacks;

A Persona can only be strenghtened once per day but there is a way to go around the system: strengthen a Persona and register it in the Compendium, after that dismiss it from your inventory. By summoning the same Persona again you will be able to strengthen it more. This method gives you infinite uses of the Gallows with the same Persona on the same day as long as you have the money to keep dismissing and resummoning;

 Question: (Joseph-Ignace Guillotin) Knowledge +1; 
 Steal Okumura’s Heart; 
 Before you proceed it's recommended to set up a team of Ryuji, Haru, and Morgana and make sure Joker has access to elec, psy, and wind skills, preferably the ones that hit multiple targets When you reach the place where the treasure was, Okumura will try to escape. You will have 10 minutes to reach him and start the boss fight. Hit  and see if have a Smokescreen. When an enemy shadows notices you, use it and you can prevent the fight. Even if you don't have a Smokescreen, enemies are easy to dodge and time is plentiful; 
 Boss Kunikazu Mammon Okumura: Again, you will have a timer before Okumura escapes but now it's 30 minutes. The boss won’t fight himself, instead, he will keep sending his robots, and you have fought all of them in this Palace already. Keep destroying the robots at the same time by using AoE spells and Baton Passing between the party member that has access to the enemy weakness and Joker. Use Attack Up on all your team with skills or items, defense down on all the enemies, abuse Baton Pass and even use elemental damaging items with someone that can't exploit weakness. Even though these items deal low damage they will enable more Baton Passes. After some time, the actual boss Execurobo MDL-ED will appear. Use Tarunda and your most powerful attacks, use skills or items to remove debuffs, especially Hunger and Defense Down. The items that the priest has available can be really useful in this fight. Guard when he is about to use his “Big Bang” attack because that is quite powerful and can one-shot all your team. Something to note is that if a character is affected with Hunger his “Big Bang” attack will actually fully heal the character instead of doing damage; 
 it can be used in your favor if the time is right. Robot Haru is the last part of this fight and she doesn’t hit hard but will self-destroy when you do a bit of damage to her. When this happens, guard with everyone;

 Blue Seed: as you are making your way to the IT President in the Side Deck, climb up the side end of the ship to reach some metal platforms. Go right and up the platforms to find a grappling hook spot. You will find yourself in a new small area with the Blue Seed and the Guardian; 
 Justice Rank 9 Spear-Wielding General and Guard Dog of Hades: At the start of the fight they will use Desperation that lowers the defense but increase their attack. They only use physical attacks but the damage is quite high, use Tarunda or Debilitate and keep your team healed; 
 Goro Akechi: First he will use his Persona Robin Hood and by now, you should know that his attacks are Bless, Curse, and Severe Physical. He can also use Almighty damage that hits everyone, keep your HP high and debuff his attack and defense; 
 When his HP drops below a certain point, Akechi will summon his second Persona, Loki. He will now start using Tetrakarn, Makarakarn, Brave Blades, and Negative Pile (can cause Despair) as well as having 2 moves per turn. This battle doesn't have any special mechanics;

 Boss Beast of Human Desires: the beast will use physical attacks on one of your party members or on everyone. The boss attacks twice a turn, normally with one attack and one debuff, and can only be damaged by magic spells. Make sure you have someone that can recover your party stats by using Matarukaja, Marakukaja, and Masukukaja, otherwise this battle can go on a death spiral if he stacks all those debuffs on your team. Try to debuff him and buff your party but don’t use all at the same time because if you go too heavy on buffs/debuffs he will cure his stats ailments and nullify yours. Once the beast grows wings, Shido will start using elemental skills and now can only be damaged by physical and gun attacks. For the third time, the beast will transform, but now it only attacks once per turn and can charge to do one big damage attack. When that happens, use Guard. There are no attack restrictions for the third phase; 
 Boss Masayoshi Samael Shido: in the first half he will only use physical attacks and can cause Fear, so be prepared to heal as soon as it happens. In his second form, he will start using elemental spells as well as act multiple times per turn. Having a Persona that blocks or repels physically will help but it’s not necessary. When Shido gets to about 25% HP he will kick all your team out of the fight and you have to end it with Joker alone. During this part, Shido still uses the same physical attacks as before but this time he will mix in severe magic spells. The spells are always used in the order of fire, ice, elec, and wind, so you can completely mitigate the spell damage by using the right Personas from the Recommended Fusion Path, Moloch drains fire, Black Frost drains ice, Trumpeter repels elec, and Quetzalcoatl resists wind. Shido can still mix in physical attacks in the middle of the spell order so don't let Joker's HP get too low;

 Yaldabaoth, God of Control: this boss looks more intimidating than he actually is. Keep him under Debilitate and keep your team buffed at all times. During the fight, he will summon 4 different weapons to fight with him and they all have different HP pools as well as resistances. Information about these weapons can be viewed in the Special Enemies table. When a new weapon is summoned it should be taken care of as soon as possible since they all have their turns and attacks. Having all 4 weapons up at the same time means the boss will have 5 attacks per turn and can kill you before you have a chance to react. This fight features unique status ailments that can be applied to your team. Overall, they don't do much. The worst ones can double the cost of skills, but that's it. Don't hold back on your items like Soma and other ones that can fully heal. It's important that you keep attacking to prevent the boss from amassing his "army" of weapons. Close to the end of the fight, Yaldabaoth will summon all weapons at the same time and start charging up for a massive attack. When this happens, you have 1 turn to attack the weapons and kill as many as you can to reduce the damage of the upcoming attack. In the next turn, make sure to guard with everyone.`},{date:"12/25to12/31",day:" You can't do anything during this period."}]},{title:"January/February",header:`

 Boss Warped Abyss: This fight can be very difficult because you can only use Joker and Akechi. The boss has access to Concentrate, Maragudyne, and Vacuum Wave, so it's extremely important that you don't use a Persona that is weak to wind, preferably use one that is resistant or blocks it. He can also apply Fear and use Almighty skills. Joker will have to be on heal duty during the majority of the fight, leaving Akechi to do damage alone. This means that this battle can take a long time and you may even run out of SP before it ends. Use items when necessary and keep yourself at over half HP.`},{date:"01/03Tue",day:` You need to go see all your teammates across the city.

 During this infiltration, you won't be able to freely explore, so just follow the path. Refuse Maruki's deal; 
 Boss Sumire Yoshizawa: you will be fighting this with Joker alone. Sumire only has Bless and Physical Attacks, and she will start buffing herself quite early with skills like Charge and Brave Steps. With her skill Sword Dance, there is a very high chance it will land a critical, especially if Brave Step is active. During this period, switch to a Persona that is resistant or immune to physical attacks. Using a Physical Ointment is also an option to mitigate the damage; 
 Boss Cendrillon and Evil Synthetic Organism: you will fight the first few rounds with only Joker and Akechi. During this phase, just worry about surviving. When your team arrives, use the first round to rearrange the party as you want. Cendrillon will use the Evil Synthetic Organisms to heal 600 HP every couple rounds.

 Boss The Shadowed One and Spear-Wielding General: the General is weak to Elec but there is a very high chance that the Shadowed One will cast Elec Wall to protect his weakness, the wall will be active for a few turns and get immediately put up again when it expires. Because of that, exploiting weaknesses in this fight is a luxury. The Shadowed One has no weaknesses and casts Mabufudyne, and the General has One-Shot Kill and Charge. This combination makes them very dangerous since they can trigger Technical Attacks by combining their skills. Status ailments don't have a high chance to work but they can keep one of them out of the fight until you do some damage to the other. You can also trigger your own Technical Attack, knocking one down and Baton Pass for some extra damage.`},{date:"01/13Fri",day:` Yakisoba Pan is available today in the School Store;

 Akechi’s Awakening.`},{date:"02/03Fri",day:` The Final Battle; 
 Maruki and Azathoth: this is the first fight in a total of 3, back-to-back. During this phase, Maruki will be protected by Azathoth's tentacles and you can't hit him without dealing with the tentacles first. When Maruki is defeated, this phase will end so you don't need to worry about Azathoth. The tentacles all have different resistances and weaknesses that will be covered in the Special Enemies section. Abuse Baton Passes by exploiting the tentacles' weaknesses and hit Maruki in the 4rd Pass. The boss can cause Fear and Dizzy that should be healed as soon as possible, having Akechi in this fight is bad since he is weak to bless, one of the boss' attacks; 
 Maruki and Adam Kadmon: in the second phase you will be fighting Maruki "alone". Only he can be targeted and you should focus everything you have, your best skills and most powerful combos, because Maruki will grind you down if not dealt with quickly. His skill Revitalize Soul deals a fixed 300 damage to everyone and heals Maruki by 1200, and Grand Palm leaves one person with 1 HP despite their defenses, so you need to hit him quickly and hit him hard to end this phase as fast as possible. Use Charge and Concentrate as well as Debilitate to do as much damage per attack as you can; 
 Adam Kadmon: phase three is the easiest. It is a scripted battle and all you have to do is resist for a few rounds until the cutscene starts. Keep healing, guarding, and debuffing the boss' attack.`}]}];const Ln=(e,t)=>{const n=e.__vccOpts||e;for(const[a,o]of t)n[a]=o;return n},Vs={class:"title_container"},Qs={class:"title"},$s={__name:"ShowTitle",props:{title:String},emits:["prevTitle","nextTitle"],setup(e,{emit:t}){return(n,a)=>(He(),wt("div",Vs,[ee("button",{onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=o=>t("prevTitle"))}," Previous "),ee("h1",Qs,dt(e.title),1),ee("button",{onClick:a[1]||(a[1]=o=>t("nextTitle"))}," Next ")]))}},Zs=Ln($s,[["__scopeId","data-v-2cf96253"]]),Xs={class:"title_container"},er={__name:"ShowHeader",props:{header:String},setup(e){return(t,n)=>(He(),wt("div",Xs,[ee("h3",null,dt(e.header),1)]))}};const tr={class:"title_container"},nr={class:"title"},ar={__name:"ShowDay",props:{date:String},emits:["prevDay","nextDay"],setup(e,{emit:t}){return(n,a)=>(He(),wt("div",tr,[ee("button",{onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=o=>t("prevDay"))}," Previous "),ee("h1",nr,dt(e.date),1),ee("button",{onClick:a[1]||(a[1]=o=>t("nextDay"))}," Next ")]))}},or=Ln(ar,[["__scopeId","data-v-60ca5ab6"]]);const ir=e=>(Ti("data-v-427207f8"),e=e(),Ri(),e),sr={class:"title_container"},rr=ir(()=>ee("div",{class:"row"},[ee("h3",null,"Day:"),ee("h3",null,"Night:")],-1)),hr={class:"row"},lr={class:"title"},ur={class:"title"},dr={__name:"ShowInstructions",props:{date:Object},emits:["prevDay","nextDay"],setup(e,{emit:t}){return console.log(e.date),(a,o)=>(He(),wt("div",sr,[rr,ee("div",hr,[ee("span",lr,dt(e.date.day),1),ee("span",ur,dt(e.date.night),1)])]))}},cr=Ln(dr,[["__scopeId","data-v-427207f8"]]);const fr={class:"container"},yr=ys('<div class="links"><a href="https://psnprofiles.com/guide/11946-persona-5-royal-100-perfect-schedule#3-recommended-fusion-path" target="_blank">Recommended fusion path</a><br><a href="https://psnprofiles.com/guide/11946-persona-5-royal#5-shadows-information" target="_blank">Shadows information</a></div><div class="footer"> All the information shown here is extracted fromm: <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/guide/11946-persona-5-royal-100-perfect-schedule">here</a>.
