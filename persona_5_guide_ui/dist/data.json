These tables are a “recommended” fusion path for people that want a super-easy experience without going deep into the fusion system. You can capture and fuse any Persona you want even if following the Recommended Fusion Path If you aren’t high enough level to capture a Persona you don’t need to grind, there is always a way to fuse or capture it later If you don't want to follow the Fusion Path, capture every Persona you encounter because they are necessary for Confidant Bonuses and Strength Ranks. If you don't follow the Fusion path and aren't capturing Personas, you won't be able to keep up with the schedule, so do one or the other You have to grind some money before proceeding with the story. In a few days, we will spend all of it. The goal is 15.000 yen. Sometimes knocking down enemies and demanding money gives more than killing them does. It depends on the amount and type of enemy you are fighting. In a battle with a lot of enemies (3 or more), it will give more money to kill them all The level of the enemy will also affect how much money they will give when you hold them at gunpoint. Higher-level enemies give more money In a few days, we will need 2 Tin Claps and 2 Silk Yarn. If you drop them from enemies, great. If not, we will have to buy it. Tin Claps cost 2.050 each and Silk Yarn costs 1.150 each. Add the ones you need to your farming total, so if you need to buy 2 Tin Claps, you will need 19.100 total. DO NOT go past the room with three Shadows and one Treasure Chest, otherwise, you will be locked into a story event and you won’t be able to grind anymore. Kill the three Shadows, go back to the entrance, save the game, and repeat; \n When you have the necessary money, continue forward to start the story events.

All the money calculations for the early game assume that you are not buying anything, be it consumables or equipment. If you want to buy something, you need to farm more money.

Pass on Eiha and Zio; \n The number of skills you are able to pass down to a new Persona when fusing depends on the level of the Personas used. A level 1 Arsene fused with a level 2 Pixie will only net one inherit skill slot. So if you are not able to pass both Eiha and Zio in this case its because you are slightly underlevel. Farming for levels is not required unless the guide says that you need a specific skill obtained at a specific level If there is only one slot available its recommended to inherit Eiha since Agathion will learn Zio at level 7, and Pixie also has Zio from the start. The key to combat is having access to as many elements as possible Fool Rank 2; \n This is a very difficult Palace because it’s so early in the game that we don’t have access to Personas, skills, or items to help us out, but we still need to finish it in one day otherwise we won’t be able to get everything in one playthrough.

And finally, the eastern shelf is where the Slave Book goes. After all the books are in place, a new path will open up; \n Will Seeds are a new mechanic in Royal, there are 3 seeds to collect in every Palace. When all 3 are collected, they will turn into an accessory that gives a powerful skill to the person that uses it. They also recover a bit of SP every time one is collected, which is an huge deal in the early game; \n Red Seed: it’s part of the tutorial, your teammates will tell you to go get it; \n Once you reach the roof, the enemies will become quite strong. It's recommended to skip all the battles until you are inside the castle again. When the Treasure is found, you can farm as much as you like, but for now, focus on reaching the end of the Palace; \n Green Seed: When you are using the grappling hook to climb the outside of the tower, the Seed will be at the very top. Enter the first window and crawl inside a vent to reach a higher area where you can use the grappling hook to get higher; \n Blue Seed: Back inside the castle, when the rooms start to shift, take the elevator down. You will see another elevator in the new area that can't be used. Continue through Kamoshida’s painting to unlock a shortcut to the very beginning of the Palace. Explore this area to find a lever that activates the other elevator. Go back through the painting and use the new elevator that we just activated to go down to a new area and fight the first Will Seed Guardian; \n Reach the treasure and farm until you are level 9 with 20.000 yen; \n Fuse Silky and Agathion to get Berith (Hierophant, 9); \n If you don't know who Silky is, the Shadow name can be found in the Shadows Information; \n Leave the Palace after securing the route to the Treasure, fusing Berith, and getting the necessary money; \n When you are ready to leave, make sure you have a Lovers Personas; \n Almost every Sunday, you can check the TV and buy unique or rare items from the Shopping Program.

Once he loses a certain amount of HP, he will heal using the chalice. Now, focus everything on the chalice until it breaks. Be sure to guard against his powerful attack (when Mishima or Shiho appear) otherwise, it can one-shot multiple people. It's possible to kill Shadow Shiho to prevent another big attack, she is weak against everything. After that, the game will enter a scripted event asking you to send someone to steal the crown from Kamoshida, while the person climbs the pillar, you will have to keep attacking Kamoshida, being unable to meet the damage requirement will make the person be spotted by Kamoshida and end the scripted event. This is not mandatory, but in lower difficulties it will end the battle a lot faster.

The Eyes drain elemental attacks and can cast all basic elemental spells, the Mouth drains physical attacks and attacks normally, and the Nose has Tarukaja and Rakunda. The best way to deal with the first phase is to use Rakunda in the Eyes and have Ryuji and Yusuke use AoE physical attacks (Yusuke needs to be level 18 to learn it) to neutralize the Eyes as soon as possible, with the Eyes out of the picture the boss gets a lot easier. In the second phase, Madarame starts summoning his elemental clones, and as you can expect, they are weak to their opposite element. Use ice against the red clones and fire against the blue, use wind against the yellow clones and elec against the green. Abuse Baton Pass by exploiting all the clones' weaknesses and kill them all in one turn. Just make sure you don’t use any spells that hit all targets because the clones will reflect their element back at you. The beginning of the second phase is a battle of attrition. Don't worry about Madarame, just make sure the clones die.

The boss attacks twice a turn, normally with one attack and one debuff, and can only be damaged by magic spells. Make sure you have someone that can recover your party stats by using Matarukaja, Marakukaja, and Masukukaja, otherwise this battle can go on a death spiral if he stacks all those debuffs on your team. Try to debuff him and buff your party but don’t use all at the same time because if you go too heavy on buffs/debuffs he will cure his stats ailments and nullify yours. Once the beast grows wings, Shido will start using elemental skills and now can only be damaged by physical and gun attacks. For the third time, the beast will transform, but now it only attacks once per turn and can charge to do one big damage attack. When that happens, use Guard. There are no attack restrictions for the third phase; \n Boss Masayoshi Samael Shido: in the first half he will only use physical attacks and can cause Fear, so be prepared to heal as soon as it happens. In his second form, he will start using elemental spells as well as act multiple times per turn. Having a Persona that blocks or repels physically will help but it’s not necessary. When Shido gets to about 25% HP he will kick all your team out of the fight and you have to end it with Joker alone. During this part, Shido still uses the same physical attacks as before but this time he will mix in severe magic spells. The spells are always used in the order of fire, ice, elec, and wind, so you can completely mitigate the spell damage by using the right Personas from the Recommended Fusion Path, Moloch drains fire, Black Frost drains ice, Trumpeter repels elec, and Quetzalcoatl resists wind. Shido can still mix in physical attacks in the middle of the spell order so don't let Joker's HP get too low; \n Read Essense of Fishing (32/46).

Information about these weapons can be viewed in the Special Enemies table. When a new weapon is summoned it should be taken care of as soon as possible since they all have their turns and attacks.

This fight features unique status ailments that can be applied to your team. Overall, they don't do much. The worst ones can double the cost of skills, but that's it. Don't hold back on your items like Soma and other ones that can fully heal. It's important that you keep attacking to prevent the boss from amassing his \"army\" of weapons.

Only he can be targeted and you should focus everything you have, your best skills and most powerful combos, because Maruki will grind you down if not dealt with quickly. His skill Revitalize Soul deals a fixed 300 damage to everyone and heals Maruki by 1200, and Grand Palm leaves one person with 1 HP despite their defenses, so you need to hit him quickly and hit him hard to end this phase as fast as possible. Use Charge and Concentrate as well as Debilitate to do as much damage per attack as you can; \n Adam Kadmon: phase three is the easiest. It is a scripted battle and all you have to do is resist for a few rounds until the cutscene starts. Keep healing, guarding, and debuffing the boss' attack."}]}]
